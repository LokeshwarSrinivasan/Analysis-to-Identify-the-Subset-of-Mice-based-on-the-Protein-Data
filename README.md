# Analysis-to-Identify-the-Subset-of-Mice-based-on-the-Protein-Data

 Goal
---------------------------------------

Comparing the Classification models â€“ K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree built on Mice Protein Expression Dataset.

Dataset contains data of 77 protein expression levels (numeric) and 4 Categorical columns
1080 0bservations
8 Class of Mice exists
Each class of Mice is described based on features Genotype, Behavior, and Treatment
Genotype : Control  or Trisomic
Behavior :  context-shock and shock-context
Treatment : memantine and saline

How to run scripts - Instructions 
---------------------------------------

1)Download from canvas Assignment2.ipynb file.
2)Upload the .ipynb file on Jupyter.
3)Upload also the dataset i.e Data_Cortex_Nuclear.csv file on Jupyter.
4)Now from options in taskbar, click on Kernel. In the drop down menu of Kernel, click on Run and Restart All Cells.
5)Finally, the output will be generated for all the cells.
